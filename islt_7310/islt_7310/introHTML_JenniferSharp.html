    <title>Welcome to Jennifer Sharp's Website</title>

    Hello, my name is Jennifer Sharp.  I am a grad student in the MLIS program, and I expect to graduate in December.  I live in St. Charles County, Missouri with my husband and our cat.  In our spare time we enjoy traveling and hiking together.  I also love doing anything crafty or DIY-related.  Sewing, woodworking, scrapbooking, crocheting, home improvement – basically anything that allows me to be creative and make things.  Lately I have been working on learning to enjoy cooking and preparing healthy food.  For the past three years I have worked in the Youth Department at my local public library, and I love my job.  It’s so rewarding getting to do something that I’m passionate about at work every day.  I have little to no web application experience.  After this course I hope to be able to create basic websites, but I’m not sure exactly how I will use them yet.
